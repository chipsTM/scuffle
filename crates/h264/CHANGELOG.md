- feat: Parsing and building Sps can now use the `EmulationPreventionIo` wrapper to automatically handle emulation prevention bytes ([#384](https://github.com/scufflecloud/scuffle/pull/384)) (@TroyKomodo)
- feat: All sps structs now have functions to retrieve their bit/byte sizes ([#384](https://github.com/scufflecloud/scuffle/pull/384)) (@philipch07)
